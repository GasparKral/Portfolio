            Hi there! here Gaspar, a passionate frontend developer and
            programmer. At just 22 years old and nearing completion of my degree
            in <span>Multiplatform Application Development (DAM)</span> , I'm thrilled
            to share my journey in the world of software development with you all.
            Recently, I discovered my love for <span> design </span>and
            <span> programming</span>, and since then, I've been dedicated to
            honing my skills in both fields.
        </p>
        <p class='xl:w-[65%] xl:self-end text-pretty xl:text-end'>
            My approach to development revolves around two core principles:
            <span> creativity</span> and <span> efficiency </span>. I enjoy
            finding innovative solutions and creating digital experiences that
            not only function flawlessly but also captivate visually. Every line
            of code I write is an opportunity to challenge myself and find ways
            to optimize the performance of my applications.
        </p>
        <p class='xl:w-[65%] xl:self-start text-pretty 2xl:mt-6'>
            Through my portfolio, you'll see how I merge my passion for design
            with my ability to write <span> clean and efficient code</span>. I'm
            eager to showcase what I can do and to contribute my talent to the
            world of application development
        </p>
